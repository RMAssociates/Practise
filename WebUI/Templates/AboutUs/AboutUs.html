                                    At Leaside Village Dental, we pride ourselves in providing highly individualized dental care in a gentle, caring and comfortable environment;
                                    all while following the highest possible standards of care which allow us to stand behind our work. We realize that the vast majority of
                                    patients have some form of dental anxiety. Hence, we ensure that our patients can come in and enjoy our warm and friendly atmosphere, heat
                                    and massage dental chairs, watch TV, or even use laughing gas if required to allay their fears; all while feeling good about getting your
                                    dental treatment done in an environmentally conscious green office!

                                    Our facility has been built to meet LEED standards and we are a completely digital office! We use digital x-rays to reduce radiation exposure
                                    for our patients and intra-oral cameras to educate our patients about their oral health. We follow the most stringent sterilization procedures
                                    and controls and have even gone the extra mile to use non-porous quartz working surfaces, touch free sterilization center operations and
                                    NanoGuard technology in our cabinets. The Nano-silver in NanoGuard kills bacteria and viruses ensuring no microbes can grow on our cabinets!
